Iris Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/987f1ec6-978d-46bc-b436-edfd7b6abd36)
(KNN)

This project demonstrates a machine learning model that classifies Iris flower species using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The model predicts species based on four flower features.

📊 Dataset

Source: Scikit-learn's built-in Iris dataset

Classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

Features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Total Samples: 150 (50 samples per species)

⚙️ Steps

Data Loading: The Iris dataset is loaded from Scikit-learn.

Data Exploration: The dataset's structure is analyzed by checking:

Dataset info

Missing values

Summary statistics

Visualization: A pairplot using seaborn is generated to observe feature distributions and relationships.

Data Preparation:

Features (X) and labels (y) are separated.

Data is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Feature scaling is applied using StandardScaler to improve model performance.

Model Training: A KNN classifier is trained with n_neighbors=3.

Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using:

Accuracy Score

Classification Report

Confusion Matrix Visualization
